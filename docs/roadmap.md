# Public implementation roadmap

This clean public lineage starts with the smallest reviewable vertical slices:

1. establish the public boundary and CI;
2. replace the current in-memory lifecycle with the two-operation
   `CivicCaseCoordinator` over an append-only journal;
3. add one department review and a redacted citizen brief;
4. add advisory participation and a read-only council rehearsal;
5. exercise three role-scoped companion contexts;
6. round-trip one reviewed public exchange record through a local Nostr
   Adapter; and
7. prove replay, correction, deletion, and reference-surface evidence locally.

Formal city authority, live operations, second-city federation, and public
relay publication require new owners, ADRs, and exact external-effects gates.
